&emsp;&ensp;  I am currently a master student in the School of Software and Microeletronics at Peking University and my major is Computer Science. I  am interested in theoretical computer science and its interplay with combinatorics, algebra and analysis.

&emsp;&ensp; I received my B.S. degree in School of Mathematics from Shandong University, China. My undergraduate grade point was 4.56/5 which ranked 1/28, and I got one national scholarship and two first-class scholarships at Shandong University. I participated in many mathematical competitions and mathematical modeling contests, which help me cultivate a solid foundation of mathematics and highly motivation to solve challenging problems. 

&emsp;&ensp;  In addition, I am enthusiastic about research and have tenacity to face failure. Except mathematical modeling contest papar, I have no publication for now because of my professional master degree in Peking University which requires me to complete an one-year internship. 

&emsp;&ensp;  Recently, I am applying Ph.D and research intern in theoretical computer science. Below are my detailed experiences and corresponding electronic materials.
