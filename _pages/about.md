My name is Li Bin, and I'm 23 years old. I am currently a third-year master student from Peking University, China.  I received my B.S. degree in Computational Mathematics from Shandong University, China. I won a national scholarship and two first-class scholarships in Shandong University,  with a grade point of 4.56/5, ranking 1/28. And I am recommended to Peking University for a master's degree in computer science. 

In terms of competition and scientific research, I have won the second prize of the National Undergraduate Mathematics Contest, the first prize of Shandong Province in the University Student Mathematical Modeling Contest, and the H prize of the American Student Mathematical Contest in Modeling. My undergraduate thesis  was a survey on graph neural networks. I am doing scientific research internships in the field of computing and storage at the AMS data center of Shandong Institute of Advanced Technology.
However, I have not published a paper yet. Without research results, I know it's difficult to become your PhD student compared with other outstanding students. But I still muster the courage to write this email to you and hope you can continue to read it.

In the freshman year, I failed a 6 credit mathematics course, which resulted in my grades ranking being 25/28. In the next two years, I studied very hard  in my major and got grades ranking 1/28, and I was admitted to Peking University because of grades. However, I did not get a chance to become an academic master or PhD due to the change from Computational Mathematics to Computer Science. I had to choose a professional master's degree at Peking University. In accordance with the requirements for a professional master's degree, I did two internships at an Internet company and an education company for a year. After the internship, I realized that I wanted to engage in scientific research and solve the problems of science and technology more than working in the company. Therefore, I applied for a scientific research internship at the Shandong Institute of Advanced Technology and hope to get a PhD degree.

During the AMS data center, I learned the content of the RISCV instruction set, and implemented a simple operating system based on RISCV; I am recently studying hardware courses and reading some papers from  ISCA, HPCA, and MICRO. I am interested in hardware and software co-design, high-performance computing and dedicated accelerators.
Thank you very much for reading my email during your busy schedule. After going through failure, I made it clear that I would like to dedicate my life to the study of science. If I have the opportunity to become your PhD student, I will definitely work harder. If not, I also hope to get your suggestion about how to apply for PhD without research results. (Resume and other documents are in the attachment. Here is the relevant report of my failure and hard study.)
